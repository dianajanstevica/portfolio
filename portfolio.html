            <h3>Responsive website</h3>

                Project description: First responsive website I've ever done, a very simple one, dedicated to Postmodernism style. </p>
            <p>In this theme I learned how to use basic html and css, as well as basic design principles. I've also learned how to make webpages responsive for different devices using css media queries and how to use semantically correct code.</p>
            <p>I definitely didn't consider this as an easy task at the moment of making the project as my UI skills at that moment were close to non-existent. Still I managed to code my first website in a quite short amount of time but of course it required a lot of hard work and research. Looking back at it, it feels like after the project I had a solid base for basic html and css, which has helped me a lot in further projects.</p>

            <p>Project description: A simple sprite sheet animation + story related documentation.</p>
            <p>In this project I learned how to use Adobe Illustrator for animation character development and turn it into a spritesheet that can be animated using css, as well as how to write a story, use storyboards and create character persona.</p>
            <p>I consider this a very interesting project, especially looking at the creation of spritesheets, I've understood that it can be a lot of work, depending on how many frames for the animation you create and how detailed you want it to be. This definitely has come in handy for other projects.</p>

            <p>Project description: An interactive movie poster for Alfred Hitchcock's <cite>Rear Window</cite>. A study case for Cinemateket. </p>
            <p>This project was a group work which included developing an animated interactive production with a call to action. I was creating a  visual concept as well as a style tile that was used throughout the project and other assets such as a gif for social media, character design etc.</p>
            <p>I used knowledge and techniques that I had learned in previous projects, such as character creation in Illustrator and spritesheet animation. It was interesting to develop a visual concept, that would be attractive to young people while keeping a connection to the style of the actual movie. The project also improved my skills in team work and compromising.</p>

            <p>Project description: A study case for the Municipality of Copenhagen - a video guide for foreigners about biking in Copenhagen + microsite with relevant information.</p>
            
            <p>In this project I was responsible for capturing the video, as well as editing both video and sound. In this theme I used the principles introduced to us such as composition, diffent types of shots ( close-ups, medium ang long shots ), camera movements ( static, panning, dolly ), 180 degree rule, handheld/stabilsed shots etc. I learned how to use Adobe Premiere for video editing and colour correction, Adobe Audition for sound work and setting up camera and sound gear. </p>
            
            <p>Personally, this has been my favourite project so far, I have experience with photography, but video production has a whole other way of telling a story as it includes a lot more aspects to it. I had a great team that helped me in dealing with time management as they set very strict deadlines and we had a great respect towards each other which resulted in a good work flow. This project improved my presentation skills as well because it was pitched in front of the whole class. </p>

            <p>Project description: Study case for Frederikke Bender, Head of Multimedia Design and Communication at KEA about developing a user friendly solution for KEA's intranet <cite>Fronter.</cite></p>
            <p>The project was a 5 day sprint with an end goal of a tested Xd prototype. In this project I contributed with researching the existing solution as well as developing a user friendly web app prototype for <cite>Fronter</cite> - KEA's existing intranet.</p>
            <p>This project allowed me to extend my knowledge in prototyping in Adobe Xd, document a research for existing solutions, follow KEA's design guide as well as run various user tests all in a very short time span. I consider design sprints a very useful tool for recieving a quick test ready prototypes as it requires a lot of quick decision making instead of endless discussions and planning. It's also very interesting to see how people produce an idea in only 5 days.</p>
